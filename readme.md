## AI Integration

This app uses **Google Gemini AI** for intelligent text processing. The AI handles three main tasks:

### 1. Classification Prompt

Classifies user input into one of four benefit categories:

```
Return ONLY one of these category names ‚Äî Dental, OPD, Vision, Mental Health ‚Äî that best matches the user text. Output exactly the category name and nothing else. If the text is ambiguous or none match, output "UNRECOGNIZED".

User text: "{user_input}"
```

**Expected Output**: `Dental` | `OPD` | `Vision` | `Mental Health` | `UNRECOGNIZED`

### 2. Clarification Prompt

Used when classification is ambiguous:

```
The user wrote: "{user_input}". Ask a single concise clarifying question that will help classify this into Dental, OPD, Vision, or Mental Health. Return ONLY the clarifying question sentence.
```

**Expected Output**: A single clarifying question string

### 3. Action Plan Prompt

Generates a structured 3-step action plan:

```
Given:

selectedBenefit: {
  title: "{benefit.title}",
  coverage: {benefit.coverage}%,
  description: "{benefit.description}"
}
user_input: "{user_input}"

Return a JSON object exactly in this shape (no extra text):
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "title": "Short title (max 6 words)",
      "description": "Action description (1-2 sentences).",
      "estimatedTime": "e.g. 1-2 days or 1 hour",
      "requiredDocs": ["list","of","docs"]
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "estimatedTime": "...",
      "requiredDocs": [...]
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "estimatedTime": "...",
      "requiredDocs": [...]
    }
  ],
  "notes": "One-sentence extra note if needed, otherwise empty string"
}
```

**Expected Output**: Strict JSON object with steps array and notes

## API Configuration

The Gemini API key is configured in `src/services/aiService.js`:

```javascript
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyDuMnKNw3dqnURwgBWOx8Gs0UgVx9qdM64';
const GEMINI_API_URL = 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent';
```

To use your own API key:

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Replace the `GEMINI_API_KEY` value in `src/services/aiService.js`

## User Flow

1. **Input Screen**: User enters their health concern (e.g., "I have tooth pain, what can I do?")
2. **Processing Screen**: Beautiful loading animation while AI classifies the request
3. **Benefits List**: 2-6 relevant benefit cards displayed based on classification
4. **Benefit Details**: User selects a benefit to view AI-generated 3-step action plan

### Features in Each Screen

**Input Screen**:
- Free-text input with friendly placeholder
- Example queries for quick testing
- Animated gradient background
- Feature highlights

**Processing Screen**:
- Animated rotating rings
- Pulsing brain icon
- Orbiting sparkles
- Status indicators
- User query display

**Benefits List**:
- Animated benefit cards with hover effects
- Coverage percentage badges
- Category tags
- Regenerate functionality
- Back navigation

**Benefit Details**:
- Full benefit overview
- AI-generated 3-step action plan
- Expandable steps with required documents
- Time estimates for each step
- Additional notes
- Regenerate action plan option

## Mock Data

The app includes 6 mock benefits across 4 categories:

- **Dental**: Cleaning & Checkup (80%), Tooth Extraction (70%), Root Canal (65%)
- **Mental Health**: Counseling (90%)
- **Vision**: Eye Exam (50%)
- **OPD**: General Consultation (75%)

Benefits are stored in `src/data/benefits.mock.json` and can be easily modified.

## State Management

The app uses Recoil for state management with the following atoms:

- `userInputState` - Current user input
- `classificationState` - AI classification result
- `selectedBenefitState` - Currently selected benefit
- `actionPlanState` - Generated action plan
- `currentScreenState` - Active screen (input/processing/benefits/details)
- `darkModeState` - Dark mode toggle
- `isClassifyingState` - Loading state for classification
- `isGeneratingPlanState` - Loading state for action plan generation

## Customization

### Adding New Benefits

Edit `src/data/benefits.mock.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "category": "Dental|OPD|Vision|Mental Health",
  "title": "Benefit Title",
  "coverage": 80,
  "description": "Benefit description",
  "icon": "ü¶∑",
  "color": "from-cyan-500 to-blue-600"
}
```

### Changing Colors

All gradients use Tailwind CSS classes. Update the `color` field in benefits or modify component gradient classes.

### Modifying Animations

Animations are defined in components using Framer Motion. Key animation files:
- `src/components/BenefitInput.jsx` - Floating background blobs
- `src/components/ProcessingScreen.jsx` - Rotating rings and orbiting elements
- `src/components/BenefitCard.jsx` - Card hover effects
- `src/index.css` - Custom CSS animations

## Assumptions & Limitations

- The app currently uses a real AI API (Google Gemini) but includes mock benefits data
- No backend or database - all data is client-side
- No user authentication
- No benefit claiming/application process
- Classification is limited to 4 predefined categories
- Action plans are AI-generated and may vary in quality

## Known Issues

- AI responses may occasionally not follow exact format (handled with error catching)
- No retry limit on API calls
- Dark mode preference not persisted across sessions
- No analytics or usage tracking

## Next Steps & Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - User authentication
   - Benefit application workflow
   - Save user history and action plans

2. **Enhanced AI**:
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Context-aware follow-up questions
   - Learning from user feedback

3. **Extended Features**:
   - Calendar integration for appointments
   - Document upload and management
   - Provider search and directory
   - Cost estimation tools
   - Claims tracking

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Screen reader optimization
   - Keyboard navigation improvements
   - ARIA labels enhancement
   - High contrast mode

5. **Performance**:
   - Code splitting
   - Image optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Testing

To test the AI classification, try these queries:

- **Dental**: "I have tooth pain", "Need dental cleaning", "Cavity treatment"
- **Vision**: "Blurry vision", "Need glasses", "Eye exam"
- **Mental Health**: "Feeling anxious", "Depression support", "Therapy sessions"
- **OPD**: "General checkup", "Fever and cold", "Medical consultation"

## Accessibility

The app includes:

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly content

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
