## 2\. Problem Understanding

The core problem this application solves is **user confusion and friction in benefits utilization**. Employees often have comprehensive benefit packages but struggle to:

1.  **Determine Relevancy**: Which benefit applies to their specific need (e.g., is "back pain" an OPD or a Mental Health issue)?
2.  **Understand Next Steps**: What is the exact process to *use* the benefit (e.g., whom to call, what documents are needed)?

**Assumptions Made:**

  * **Fixed Categories**: The AI classification is limited to the four defined categories: **Dental, OPD, Vision, and Mental Health**.
  * **Client-Side Data**: Benefit details are served from a static mock JSON file (`benefits.mock.json`), implying the system currently has no live backend for benefit management.
  * **API Key Management**: For this demonstration, the Gemini API key is stored client-side in `aiService.js`. **In a production environment, all API calls must be proxied through a secure backend.**

-----

## 3\. AI Prompts & Iterations

The application uses **Google Gemini AI** for three distinct and critical tasks. The prompts are aggressively engineered to force a predictable, structured output for reliable client-side processing.

### Task 1: Intelligent Classification

**Goal**: Pinpoint the benefit category from ambiguous user text.
**Key Constraint**: Must return **ONLY** the category name to simplify matching with mock data.

| Prompt Type | Initial Prompt Draft | Refined Prompt Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | "What category is this: {user\_input}? Choose from Dental, OPD, Vision, Mental Health." | **"Return ONLY one of these category names â€” Dental, OPD, Vision, Mental Health â€” that best matches the user text. Output exactly the category name and nothing else. If the text is ambiguous or none match, output 'UNRECOGNIZED'."** |

### Task 2: Clarification Question

**Goal**: Get necessary information when the initial classification fails (`UNRECOGNIZED`).
**Key Constraint**: Must return **ONLY** a single, concise question.

| Prompt Type | Initial Prompt Draft | Refined Prompt Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clarification** | "The user needs more help. Ask them a question about {user\_input} to get to Dental, OPD, Vision, or Mental Health." | **"The user wrote: '{user\_input}'. Ask a single concise clarifying question that will help classify this into Dental, OPD, Vision, or Mental Health. Return ONLY the clarifying question sentence."** |

### Task 3: Personalized Action Plan Generation

**Goal**: Create a structured, easy-to-follow 3-step plan for the selected benefit.
**Key Constraint**: Must return **STRICT JSON** matching the defined schema for safe parsing.

| Prompt Type | Initial Prompt Draft | Refined Prompt Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Action Plan** | "Generate 3 steps to use this benefit: {benefit} for this problem: {user\_input}. Include required documents and time." | **(See full prompt in code for the complex JSON template)** |

> The final Action Plan prompt includes the entire JSON schema as part of the instruction to guarantee the exact structure required by the client-side code (`BenefitDetails.jsx`).

## 4\. Architecture & Code Structure

The application follows a clean, component-based, and modular React architecture.

### Directory Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # Reusable UI components (Input, Cards, Details)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BenefitInput.jsx      # Initial input screen
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProcessingScreen.jsx  # Loading/classification screen
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BenefitDetails.jsx    # Benefit details & action plan view
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **benefits.mock.json** # Static benefit data source
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **aiService.js** # Single point of contact for all Gemini API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ state/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ **atoms.js** # Central Recoil state definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ **App.jsx** # Main application component & screen router
â””â”€â”€ main.jsx
```

### State Management (`state/atoms.js`)

**Recoil** is used for global state to efficiently manage the flow:

  * `userInputState`: Stores the user's initial query.
  * `classificationState`: Stores the AI's category result (`Dental`, `OPD`, etc.).
  * `actionPlanState`: Stores the complex JSON object generated by the AI for the action plan.
  * `currentScreenState`: Manages the application flow (Input -\> Processing -\> Benefits -\> Details).

### AI Integration (`services/aiService.js`)

This file abstracts the API interaction, containing helper functions that construct the three specific prompts (Classification, Clarification, Action Plan) and handle the API request/response. This separation keeps components clean and focused on UI logic.

## 5\. Screenshots / Screen Recording

| Screen | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input Screen** | Creative UI with floating elements, Dark Mode toggle, and a clear call-to-action for the user query. |
| **Processing Screen** | Engaging loading state with Framer Motion animations (rotating rings, pulsing icon) to mask AI latency. |
| **Benefits List** | Dynamically filtered benefit cards with coverage badges and category tags based on AI classification. |
| **Benefit Details** | Full benefit overview alongside the structured, 3-step AI-generated action plan, using collapsable sections for clarity. |

## 6\. Known Issues / Improvements

### Known Issues

  * **AI Format Drift**: The Gemini API occasionally deviates slightly from the strict JSON structure for the Action Plan, requiring robust client-side error handling/parsing.
  * **No Persistence**: Dark mode preference and any past user inputs are not saved across sessions (no local storage integration).
  * **Rate Limiting**: There is no built-in API rate-limiting or retry logic, which would be necessary for production stability.

### Future Improvements

1.  **Backend & Persistence**: Introduce a backend (e.g., Firebase, Express) for user authentication, secure API key storage, and persistence of user history/action plans.
2.  **Multi-Turn Conversation**: Implement a memory-aware chat flow for the AI to handle follow-up questions *after* a benefit is selected, enhancing personalized guidance.
3.  **Accessibility (A11Y)**: Enhance keyboard navigation and add ARIA Live Regions to dynamically announce status changes on the `ProcessingScreen`.

## 7\. Bonus Work

The project includes significant polish and enhancements to create a visually appealing and engaging user experience:

âœ¨ **Stunning Animations**: Extensive use of **Framer Motion** for all screen transitions, floating elements (e.g., background blobs), and interactive micro-interactions (e.g., card hover effects).

ðŸŒ™ **Seamless Dark Mode**: Full support for a dark theme with beautifully contrasting gradients and glassmorphism effects, managed efficiently via a **Recoil** state atom.

ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI/UX**: The design employs a creative, non-traditional aesthetic featuring **Glassmorphism** cards, custom gradient backgrounds, and sleek typography from Tailwind CSS, resulting in a unique, premium feel.
